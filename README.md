Directus3D is a game engine that started as a hobby project and evolved into something greater.
The source code is clean, modern and tackles a lot of aspects of engine development. Have fun!

Note: This project is in an early development stage and there is a lot experimentation going on, regarding what works best.
As a result, no design decision is set in stone and it will take a while until the engine is ready to produce games.
Code quality is prioritized over development speed.
